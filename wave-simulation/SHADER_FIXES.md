# Wave Simulation Shader Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. OpenGL Version Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: The main.cpp was requesting OpenGL 3.0 context while the shaders use `#version 330 core`, which requires OpenGL 3.3.

**Fix**: Updated display configuration to request OpenGL 3.3:
```cpp
al_set_new_display_flags(ALLEGRO_OPENGL | ALLEGRO_OPENGL_3_0 | ALLEGRO_PROGRAMMABLE_PIPELINE);
al_set_new_display_option(ALLEGRO_OPENGL_MAJOR_VERSION, 3, ALLEGRO_REQUIRE);
al_set_new_display_option(ALLEGRO_OPENGL_MINOR_VERSION, 3, ALLEGRO_REQUIRE);
```

### 2. Missing Programmable Pipeline Flag
**Problem**: The ALLEGRO_PROGRAMMABLE_PIPELINE flag was missing, which is required for shader support.

**Fix**: Added the flag to display creation flags.

### 3. Shader Compilation Error Handling
**Problem**: Shader compilation errors were not properly caught, and the application would continue with invalid shaders.

**Fix**: Enhanced error checking in ShaderManager:
- Added return value validation for shader compilation
- Added comprehensive error messages
- Added uniform location validation with warnings

### 4. Wave Shader Logic Issues
**Problem**: Several issues in the wave shaders that could cause rendering problems:
- Normal calculation was incomplete (missing mouse interaction in neighbor calculations)
- Fragment shader height thresholds were incorrect for the actual wave height ranges
- Color ranges could result in very dark/black output

**Fix**: 
- Fixed normal calculation to include mouse interaction waves in neighbor height calculations
- Adjusted fragment shader color ranges to ensure visible output
- Added minimum brightness to prevent completely black output
- Improved height factor normalization

### 5. Cross-platform Math Constants
**Problem**: M_PI might not be defined on all platforms.

**Fix**: Added conditional definition of M_PI in WaveRenderer.cpp.

## Shader Logic Validation

Created a simulation test that validates the wave shader logic produces proper colors:

```
Wave Heights at different positions:
Pos(-1,-1): height=-0.070701 -> color(0.14293,0.42879,0.72879)
Pos(-1,-0.5): height=0.0273009 -> color(0.15273,0.45819,0.75819)
...
```

The test confirms that:
1. Wave heights vary properly across positions and time
2. Colors are calculated correctly and are not black
3. Wave animation progresses smoothly over time

## Expected Visual Result

With these fixes, the wave simulation should now display:
- **Animated water surface** with wave motion instead of black screen
- **Blue water colors** ranging from deep blue (valleys) to light blue (peaks)  
- **White foam** on wave peaks above threshold height
- **Interactive ripples** when clicking with mouse
- **Smooth lighting** with specular reflections
- **Camera orbiting** around the wave surface

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Robustness**: Added comprehensive error checking and fallback systems
2. **Debugging**: Added debug output to track rendering parameters
3. **Visual Quality**: Fixed shader calculations to ensure proper wave animation and colors
4. **Compatibility**: Fixed OpenGL version requirements and cross-platform issues
5. **Fallback System**: Added test shader fallback if wave shaders fail to load

## Files Modified

- `src/main.cpp` - Fixed OpenGL context setup
- `src/ShaderManager.cpp` - Enhanced error checking and validation
- `src/WaveRenderer.cpp` - Added debugging and fallback system
- `shaders/wave.vert` - Fixed normal calculation and coordinate issues
- `shaders/wave.frag` - Improved color ranges and lighting
- `include/WaveRenderer.h` - Added shader switching method

The wave simulation should now render properly with animated waves instead of a black or single-color output.
